# Coffee Shop Full Stack Project

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

Based on your role, you are permitted to access a limited amount of information. A pubblic user, who is not authenticated, can only get all the drinks while a barista can get all drinks and also see the recipe information for each drink.
A manager is the only one permitted to create new drinks and edit existing drinks while being also able to get drinks and their recipes.

## About the Stack
This project makes use of Ionic and Angular for the frontend and Flask, SQLAlchemy and SQLite for the backend. To be able to run this project locally, all aforementioned packages/libraries must be installed first.
